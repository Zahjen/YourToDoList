# YourToDoList

Hi and welcome! Here you could find a to do list. YOUR to do list! 

This is a very simple to do list that has been coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We are using local storage to store datas we entered, i.e. things to do. Therefore, if you leave the web page, turn on your device, or wathever, as long as you use the same browser, when coming back to the page, it is as you left it.
 
Basically, it allows you to create something to do, to check it when it is done, and finally delete it when you no longer need it. 
There is also a 'clear all' button to delete everything, whether in the local storage or on the web page.

:bangbang::bangbang: Do not use personal / sensitive informations as items for this to do list (for instance password). Indeed, datas are not encrypted, and therefore, easily accessible and editable to any user having access to this browser :bangbang::bangbang:
